### Hello 👋, I'm Chris, a fullstack developer, software engineer, electrical engineer and maker.  I love creating mobile, desktop, enterprise and IoT solutions. Let's connect to discuss what I can do for you. 

 ⭐ 🎓 📜 Fullstack Academy Grad
 
 ⭐ 🎓 📜 BSEE Ohio State University

<b>What I'm Working On:</b> Freelance software engineering gig for integrating <b>AI</b> features into a <b>Full Stack</b> learning app.</b> Creating [user-friendly libraries](https://github.com/chrisallenarmbruster/dcp-module) and modules for [DCP](https://dcp.rev4labs.com), an IoT protocol I developed.  Inspired by the simplicity of what Node Express does for HTTP, I aim to do the same for the Internet of Things. 🔨 🔧 🪛
